# 📝 Problem Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## 📥 Input Format
- `prices`: List of integers where `prices[i]` represents the stock price on the `i-th` day.

## 📤 Output Format
- Returns an integer representing the maximum profit that can be achieved.

## 🔗 Constraints
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## 💡 Approaches
### Approach: Two Pointers
1. Use two pointers: `l` (buying day) and `r` (selling day).
2. Initialize `l = 0` and `r = 1`, and set `mxP = 0` to store the maximum profit.
3. Iterate through the list with `r`:
   - If `prices[l] < prices[r]`, calculate profit and update `mxP` if it is the maximum so far.
   - If `prices[l] >= prices[r]`, move `l` to `r` (new buying day).
   - Increment `r`.
4. Return `mxP` as the result.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        l, r = 0, 1  # Left pointer (buy), Right pointer (sell)
        mxP = 0  # Max profit
        
        while r < len(prices):
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
                mxP = max(mxP, profit)
            else:
                l = r  # Update buying day
            r += 1  # Move to next day
        
        return mxP
```

This approach efficiently finds the maximum profit using a single pass through the list (O(n) time complexity) and requires constant space (O(1)).
