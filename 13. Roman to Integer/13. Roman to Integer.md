# 13. Roman to Integer

## 📝 Problem Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D`, and `M`. Each symbol has a specific value:

| Symbol | Value  |
|--------|--------|
| I      | 1      |
| V      | 5      |
| X      | 10     |
| L      | 50     |
| C      | 100    |
| D      | 500    |
| M      | 1000   |

Given a Roman numeral string `s`, convert it to an integer.

### Rules:
1. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
2. In some cases, a smaller numeral appears before a larger numeral, indicating subtraction. 
   - `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
   - `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
   - `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

## 📥 Input Format

- A string `s` containing Roman numerals.

## Constraints:
  - 1 <= s.length <= 15
  - s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
  - It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

---

## 📤 Output Format

- An integer representing the value of the Roman numeral.

---

## 💡 Approach

1. Create a dictionary `roman` to map Roman numeral symbols to their respective integer values.
2. Initialize a variable `integer` to store the resultant integer value.
3. Iterate through the string `s`:
   - If the current numeral is less than the next numeral, subtract its value from `integer`.
   - Otherwise, add its value to `integer`.
4. Return the final value of `integer`.

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`, as we iterate through it once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), as we use a fixed amount of additional space.

## 🛠️ Solution in Python

```python
def romanToInt(s):
    roman = {
        "I": 1,
        "V": 5,
        "X": 10,
        "L": 50,
        "C": 100,
        "D": 500,
        "M": 1000
    }
    integer = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i + 1 < len(s) and roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i + 1]]:
            integer -= roman[s[i]]
        else:
            integer += roman[s[i]]
    return integer
