# 27. Remove Element

## 📝 Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, you need to remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` **in-place**. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

### Requirements:
1. Modify the array `nums` so that the first `k` elements contain the elements that are **not equal to `val`**.
2. The remaining elements beyond `k` do not matter and can be left as is.
3. Return `k` (the count of elements that are not equal to `val`).

### Custom Judge:
The solution will be validated as follows:
1. The judge will check that the first `k` elements of `nums` match the expected output.
2. The order of the first `k` elements does not need to match the input order.
3. The elements beyond `k` are not checked.

## 📥 Input Format

1. An integer array `nums`.
2. An integer `val` to be removed from `nums`.

---

## 📤 Output Format

1. An integer `k`, the count of elements in `nums` not equal to `val`.
2. The modified array `nums` such that the first `k` elements contain the elements that are not equal to `val`.

## 🔗 Constraints

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
- 0 <= val <= 100

---

## 💡 Approach

1. Initialize a `count` variable to keep track of the index for elements that are not equal to `val`.
2. Iterate through the array `nums`:
   - If the current element is **not equal** to `val`, place it at index `count` and increment `count`.
   - Otherwise, skip the element.
3. At the end of the loop, `count` will represent the number of elements not equal to `val`.
4. Return `count`.

This approach ensures that the array is modified in place without requiring extra space.

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of `nums`, as we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), as we do not use any additional space.

## 🛠️ Solution in Python

```python
def removeElement(nums, val):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != val:
            nums[count] = nums[i]
            count += 1
    return count
