# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! This repo contains solutions to various DSA problems, organized by data structure and algorithm type. It is designed to help you improve your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of key concepts in computer science.

## 🚀 About the Repo

This repository covers the following areas:

- **Arrays**: Operations, sorting, searching, and common array-based problems.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly linked lists, and operations on them.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Implementation and typical problems like balancing parentheses and more.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, traversals, and more.
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, and graph traversal techniques.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, and their complexities.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization problems, memoization, and tabulation techniques.
